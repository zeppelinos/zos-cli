# ZeppelinOS Command Line Interface

This package provides a unified command line interface to [ZeppelinOS](https://zeppelinos.org/).

ZeppelinOS is a platform to develop, manage and operate smart contract applications in Ethereum. It can be used to create smart contract systems that can be fixed and improved over time, enabling developers to opt-in to mutability for their deployed code through [upgradeability patterns](https://blog.zeppelinos.org/proxy-patterns/). `zos` also provides an interface to connect your application code to already deployed standard libraries.

## :warning: This repo is deprecated :warning:

This package has been moved to a monorepo at [zeppelinos/zos](https://github.com/zeppelinos/zos/tree/master/packages/cli#readme). The github repository will remain open to keep the issues up until they are either closed or migrated.
